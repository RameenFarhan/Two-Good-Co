This project is inspired by the original Two Good Co website, an Australian social enterprise that empowers women affected by homelessness, domestic violence, and trauma. The company reinvests much of its profits to create meaningful employment opportunities.

The website is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with animations powered by GSAP, ScrollTrigger, and Locomotive Scroll, and uses Remix Icon for the logo and icons.
